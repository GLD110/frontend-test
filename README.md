## Summary

The goal of this test is to make you code an small AngularJS app. We have prepared the skeleton of an app for you, but please edit whatever you want in it (Gulpfile, CSS files, HTML structure...)! Show us what you can do in a max of 6 hours :)

The app must display an Activity Feed: a list of taken, made or missed calls and a detail of each calls on a different page.

**Bonus:** the final user should be able to archive a call. The call will not be displayed anymore on the Activity Feed. Please code that only if you have free time.
